# XenRP: RageMP RP Gamemode (Based on [Wired-RP](https://github.com/xabier1989/WiredPlayers-RP))
XenRP is a RolePlay project made for RAGE Multiplayer, it uses C# as main language for both server and client. It is based on [Wired-RP](https://github.com/xabier1989/WiredPlayers-RP) and will slowly be deviating further from this source. 


## Changes from Wired-RP (actively adding more)
* Ditched multilingual support due to issues with culture in .Net Core 2.2

## Getting Started

### 1.Prerequisites

* [RAGE Multiplayer](https://cdn.gtanet.work/RAGE_Multiplayer.zip) - The client to login into the server
* [Bridge plugin](https://cdn.gtanet.work/bridge-package.zip) - The plugin allowing use to use C# server-side
* [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) - The database to store the data
* [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) - The SDK to develop C# resources
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/ro/index.html) - The mysql server/client. Easy to use but you can choose others from the internet. That's only the suggested one.

**Note:** This project has only been tested under Windows environments, and it's not working right now on Linux distributions

### 2.Installing the Server
1. Install the .msi file that comes into RAGE Multiplayer's .zip file
2. Execute the **updater.exe** located on the root folder where you installed RAGE Multiplayer
3. Unzip the Bridge plugin into the folder called **server-files** replacing the files if needed
4. Execute again the **updater.exe** located on the root folder where you installed RAGE Multiplayer in order for it to update to the bridge plugin
5. Create a file called **enable-clientside-cs.txt** on the root folder where you installed RAGE Multiplayer (on your local PC, not on the server)
6. Make sure your router has opened 22005 UDP port and 22006 TCP/IP, if you dont know how to do that just google for router port forwarding

### 3.Installing the GameMode

5. Make sure your solution has linked the **MySql.Data** Nuget, if not, add it to the project
